## Description

This repository holds the main python package for the GNN Tracking project.
See the [readme of the organization][organization-readme] for an overview of the task.

## Setup and testing

1. Set up a conda environment with one of the `environment/*.yml` files
2. Run `pip3 install -e '.[testing]'`
3. Run `pytest` to check if everything worked

## Development setup

Install the pre-commit hooks with

```bash
pip3 install -e '.[testing,dev]'
pre-commit install
```

If you open a PR and pre-commit fails for formatting,, comment`pre-commit.ci run`
to trigger a fixup commit from `pre-commit`.
